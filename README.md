About Me
I am a passionate frontend developer with a strong interest in creating visually appealing and highly interactive web applications. My journey into web development started with a fascination for how design and functionality come together to shape user experiences. This led me to explore various development tools and frameworks, gradually honing my skills in building responsive and accessible user interfaces.

With a background in 3D modeling, Photoshop, and Python, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to frontend development, combining technical knowledge with a creative eye. I believe that understanding the broader context of visual design is key to delivering solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Here are some of the technologies I work with:

Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Python

Frameworks: React, Next.js

Libraries & Tools: Webpack

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Other Tools: Figma, Photoshop, 3ds Max

I am continuously expanding my knowledge and always on the lookout for new technologies and tools to improve my workflow and enhance my capabilities.

What's Next
My goal is to deepen my expertise in frontend development and venture into full-stack roles, with a focus on modern web technologies and 3D applications. I am particularly interested in the intersection of web development and 3D, and I see a lot of potential for creating more immersive online experiences.
