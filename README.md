# Hi, I'm Daniil Pavlov 👋

## About Me

I am a Multimedia Technology (VR/AR) student and aspiring frontend developer with a strong interest in creating visually appealing and interactive web applications. My journey into development began with a curiosity about how design and functionality come together to shape user experience, which led me to explore modern web technologies and interactive media.

With a background in 3D modeling, Photoshop, and programming, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to frontend development, combining technical skills with a creative mindset. I am particularly interested in projects where visual design, interactivity, and technology intersect.
